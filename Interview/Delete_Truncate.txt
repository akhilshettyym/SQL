1. Command Type
DELETE:
A Data Manipulation Language (DML) command.
Deletes specific rows from a table based on a WHERE clause condition.
Used when you need to delete specific rows from a table.
Ex - DELETE FROM employees WHERE department = 'HR';
Supports filtering with conditions.
Slower because it logs individual row deletions for recovery and can trigger ON DELETE triggers.
Each row deletion is treated as a separate transaction.

TRUNCATE:
A Data Definition Language (DDL) command.
Removes all rows from a table without conditions.
Used when you want to remove all rows from a table and reset its structure.
Ex - TRUNCATE TABLE employees;
Does not allow conditions or filtering.
Faster as it deallocates entire data pages without logging individual row deletions.
Does not fire triggers.
