What are the different subsets of SQL :

SQL (Structured Query Language) can be categorized into several subsets, each designed for specific tasks in managing and interacting with a database. The main subsets of SQL are as follows:

1. Data Query Language (DQL)
Used to retrieve data from the database.
SELECT – Extracts data based on specified conditions.
Ex - SELECT name, age FROM employees WHERE department = 'IT';

2. Data Definition Language (DDL) - defines the structure
Defines and modifies the structure of database objects like tables, indexes, and schemas.
1. CREATE – Creates a new table, view, or database object.
2. ALTER – Modifies the structure of an existing object.
3. DROP – Deletes objects like tables or databases.
4. TRUNCATE – Removes all rows from a table (resets structure).
Ex - CREATE TABLE employees (
     id INT PRIMARY KEY,
     name VARCHAR(50),
     age INT
    );

3. Data Manipulation Language (DML)
Purpose: Manipulates data within tables (insert, update, delete).
INSERT – Adds new records to a table.
UPDATE – Modifies existing records.
DELETE – Removes specific records.
Ex - INSERT INTO employees (id, name, age) VALUES (1, 'Alice', 30);
Ex - UPDATE employees SET age = 31 WHERE name = 'Alice';
Ex - DELETE FROM employees WHERE age > 50;

4. Data Control Language (DCL)
Purpose: Controls access to the database by managing permissions.
GRANT – Grants permissions to users.
REVOKE – Revokes permissions from users.
Ex - GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON employees TO user1;
Ex - REVOKE INSERT ON employees FROM user1;

5. Transaction Control Language (TCL)
Purpose: Manages transactions to ensure the integrity of database operations.
BEGIN or START TRANSACTION – Initiates a transaction.
COMMIT – Saves the changes made in a transaction.
ROLLBACK – Reverts changes made during a transaction.
SAVEPOINT – Sets a savepoint within a transaction.
Ex - BEGIN TRANSACTION;
Ex - UPDATE employees SET salary = salary * 1.1 WHERE department = 'Sales';
Ex - ROLLBACK;

6. Data Administration Language (DAL) (Less Common)
Purpose: Focuses on database administration tasks.
CREATE USER – Creates a new database user.
DROP USER – Deletes an existing database user.
CREATE USER admin IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
